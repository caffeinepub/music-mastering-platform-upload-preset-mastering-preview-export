# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Promote the approved App draft Version 9 to production by deploying both frontend and backend canister(s), then validate via a production smoke test of core user flows.

**Planned changes:**
- Deploy the current approved draft (App draft Version 9) to the production environment for both frontend and backend canister(s).
- Run a post-deployment production smoke test covering: landing page load, Internet Identity auth, Mastering Studio navigation, audio upload, preset application, WAV export, and projects list load/update verification.

**User-visible outcome:** The production URL serves App draft Version 9, and users can complete the core mastering flow (sign in, open studio, upload audio, apply a preset, export WAV, and see projects updating) without deployment/runtime errors.
